    <p>Voting Record is an open-source civic project that endeavors to take important data from PDFs hidden away on the City of Portland website, and make it easily accessible and readable to enable others to learn, educate, research, or plan.</p>
    <p>It's currently being developed slowly, but steadily on weekends and during Big Room Studios' weekly Hack Night.</p>
    <p>If you're a developer and want to help out, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/sethwklein/voting-record">source on GitHub</a>. Reach out and say hello!</p>
