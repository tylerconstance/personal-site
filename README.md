# Personal Site (2017)

My personal site hasn't had an update since December 2014, and I'm overdue for a change. The previous site was a PicoCMS blog with a contact form. This time around, I decided to simplify even more.

I'll consider Handlebars or Pug if it becomes necessary, but in the meantime, I'm enjoying the purity of HTML + CSS.

## Getting Started Locally
Clone this repo, and then run `npm install` followed by `gulp`. That's it!
